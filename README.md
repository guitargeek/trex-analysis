### How to work on these slides

This notebook is meant to be presented in the form of slides. Do convert the notebook into HTML slides, open the notebook and navigate over the __File__ menu through __Download as__ to __Reveal.js slides (.html)__. You can open the downloaded slides with your browser and present them in fullscreen.

To structure the slide division of the notebook, enable "Slideshow" toolbar under the __View__ menu in the __Cell Toolbar__ submenu. For every cell which should correspond to the  beginning of a new slide, the _Slide Type_ has to be set to "Slide". The slide type of the other cells should be left empty.
